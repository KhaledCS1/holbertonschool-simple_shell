.SH NAME
simple_shell \- A lightweight custom UNIX shell written in C.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B simple_shell
.RI [ input_file ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B simple_shell
is a minimalist UNIX shell developed for educational purposes. It replicates core behaviors of traditional shells, including command parsing, execution, and basic built-in support.

This project is structured into modular components to enhance readability, maintainability, and functionality.

.SH MODULES
.TP
.B main.c
The entry point of the shell. Initializes the shell loop, reads user input, and coordinates command processing.

.TP
.B builtin_env.c
Implements built-in commands such as
.B env
to display environment variables. It interacts directly with the
.B environ
global variable.

.TP
.B exec_command.c
Handles the execution of external programs. This includes:
.BR fork (2),
.BR execve (2),
and process status tracking via
.BR waitpid (2).

.TP
.B parser.c
Responsible for lexical analysis. It tokenizes user input, manages argument arrays, and sanitizes whitespace.

.TP
.B path_utils.c
Resolves the absolute path of commands by iterating through the directories listed in the
.B PATH
environment variable.

.TP
.B memory_utils.c
Provides memory allocation and cleanup utilities to prevent memory leaks and ensure safe execution.

.SH FEATURES
.TP
\fB✔ Executes external commands\fR
.TP
\fB✔ Built-in environment variable display (env)\fR
.TP
\fB✔ PATH resolution for commands\fR
.TP
\fB✔ Error handling for invalid commands\fR
.TP
\fB✔ Clean and modular C code architecture\fR

.SH LIMITATIONS
This shell does not currently support:
.IP \(bu 2
Redirection (>, >>, <)
.IP \(bu 2
Pipes (|), job control, or background processes (&)
.IP \(bu 2
Scripting or configuration files (e.g. .bashrc)

.SH USAGE
After launching, the shell enters an interactive loop or reads commands from a specified input file. It parses each command, resolves the binary path, then creates a child process to execute the command.

.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
Launch shell in interactive mode:
.B ./simple_shell

.TP
Execute a batch script:
.B ./simple_shell script.txt

.TP
Display environment variables:
.B env
